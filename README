# EDGe-Thermal-Analysis
Encoder decoder generative networks for static and transient thermal analysis. 

## How to run:

Copy the Steady_runs and Transient_runs directories into the same directory as
this script/README.

A simple python3.6 thermal_encoder_decoder.py should start the training.

The following libraries are needed:
-- numpy 
-- tensorflow2.1
-- matplotlib3.1.1
-- csv
-- glob

A simple pip3 install <package> --user will install missing libraries. 


Disclaimer: A lot of numbers are hardcoded (which one is used as test, what is
the) for saving time. I can clean
up and provide the script in a better way once things are static in terms of
parameters to use.
